He was a janitor. My friend came down with an infection, and the doctors didn\'t know what to do. So they brought in the janitor. He was a doctor. And a Buraku - one of Japan\'s untouchables. His ancestors had been slaughterers, gravediggers. And this guy knew that he wasn\'t accepted by the staff, didn\'t even try. He didn\'t dress well. He didn\'t pretend to be one of them. People around that place didn\'t think he had anything they wanted, except when they needed him - because he was right, which meant that nothing else mattered. And they had to listen to him.\"\n\n-House - Son of Coma Guy Season 3 Episode 7\n\n\n\n\"What\'s this?

If my lawn was half as well maintained as that, pigeons wouldn\'t have the nerve to poop on it.\n\nPatient: Good grooming is important.\n\nDr. House: Is that a shot?\n\nPatient: People do judge you on your appearance. When you entered, I noted your shirt hadn\'t been pressed and you hadn\'t shaved in quite some time. I extracted that you were a person for whom detail is not a major concern. I was worried you might apply the same standard in your work.\n\nDr. House: You use toe-nail clippers up there?\n\nPatient: They\'re longer, so they allow me to better reach the upper hairs.\n\nDr. House: I am wearing a rumpled shirt, and I forgot to brush my hair this week.

You noticed he was a mama\'s boy because of the way he blinked his left eye. I\'m not interested. I\'m not impressed. There are only two reasons anyone would want to screw with me tonight.
